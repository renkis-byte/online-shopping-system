# Welcome to Will's Online Shopping System!

The following is a template for a very basic (books, movies, and clothes only) online shopping system. Some of the main features include...

1) Product parsing based on an input file
2) Keyword searching, with each product containing multiple, unique, descriptive keywords
3) Cart system (adding, checkouts, etc.)

To run the program (with the input file here being your desired database), use the following code in the command line:

make amazon
./amazon (your input file here)
